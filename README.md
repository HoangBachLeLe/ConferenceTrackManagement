You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

- The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
- Each session contains multiple talks.
- Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
- Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
- The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
- No talk title has numbers in it.
- All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
- Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you don’t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

## How to run the application?
In order to run the application you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Execute the following command:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/hoangbachlele/conferencetrackmanagement:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/hoangbachlele/conferencetrackmanagement:latest
```

Then open the web page `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.
